- Accent color: Use a calming teal (#008080) to highlight important interactive elements such as call-to-action buttons and links, aligning with Windows 11's accent color approach.
- Incorporate symbols of care: hearts, hands, children, puzzle/infinity elements (sensitively) to enhance the message. Use a modern, minimalist icon style similar to Windows 11.
- Mobile-first, fully responsive design to ensure accessibility on all devices, adopting a fluid and adaptive layout reminiscent of Windows 11's responsive design principles.
